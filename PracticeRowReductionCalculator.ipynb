    "Performing row operations to get a matrix in rref can be a tedious process, especially when it comes to making computational mistakes. Now, most online calculators handle this problem, which is great, but they also handle the thinking required to come up with row operations, so you lose out on the fun!<br> **This calculator generates a random matrix each time you run the notebook, so you can get tons of practice at your row reducing skills!**"
