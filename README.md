# RowReducingCalculator
### Welcome to the Matrix Row Reducing Calculator! <br>

This project takes the form of a jupyter notebook, and is intended for the use of students/instructors, especially those who are studying/teaching linear algebra. <br>

Written in Python, using the SymPy library and fractions module, this calculator differs itself from others by: <br> 
- Requiring students to be the ones to come up with the elementary row operations needed to reduce a matrix into Reduced Row Echelon Form
- Taking care of only the computational side of things, preventing errors, but not sacrificing a user's opportunity to practice their skills
- The calculator has two versions, one where the user enters a matrix, another that randomly generates a matrix, the latter is intended for more challanging practice.
